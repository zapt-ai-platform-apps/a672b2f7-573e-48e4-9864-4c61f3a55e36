# Football Subs

Football Subs is an app designed to help coaches manage substitutions for kids' football teams. It ensures that each player gets a fair amount of game time while keeping all players engaged and involved. The app allows coaches to monitor player playtimes and make informed substitution decisions in real-time.

## Features

- **Persistent Player List**: Stores players so they are available for every game. Player lists are saved locally on your device.
- **Add Players During Game**: Allows the coach to add new players even after the game has started. New players are given the same total current playtime as the player with the least playtime who is not the current goalkeeper when they are added.
- **Goalkeeper Management**: Allows the coach to assign and reassign the goalkeeper at any time without affecting substitutions. When the goalkeeper is changed and the previous goalkeeper becomes an outfield player, their total playtime is set to match the player with the least playtime at that moment. The goalkeeper's playing time is not counted while they are in goal.
- **Game Setup**: Input the list of players and number of players on the field at a time.
- **Select Starting Line-up**: Choose which players will start on the field by checking the box next to their name.
- **Substitution Management**: Coaches can manage substitutions seamlessly, with the substitution interface always available. Players off the field are ordered by ascending total playtime, helping coaches identify who needs more time on the field.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Players' playing times update every second during the game, providing accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Player Ordering**: Players are ordered by their total playing time, with those who have played the least time at the top.
- **Pause Functionality**: Ability to pause the game clock during stoppages like half-time.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and user-friendly on all screen sizes.
