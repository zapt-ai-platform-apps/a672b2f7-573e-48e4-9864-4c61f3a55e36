# Football Subs

Football Subs is an app designed to help coaches manage substitutions and track game events for kids' football teams. It ensures that each player gets a fair amount of game time while keeping all players engaged and involved. The app allows coaches to monitor player playtimes—including or excluding goalkeeper playtime based on preference—manage substitutions, track scores, record goal events, review detailed game summaries in real-time, **visualize player positions on a virtual pitch**, and share the match summary directly from the app once the match has ended.

## Important Note

- **Goalkeeper Playtime Handling**: When you choose to exclude the goalkeeper's playtime from totals, the app now accurately freezes the goalkeeper's playtime while they are in goal. Changing the goalkeeper will no longer reset their accumulated playtime to zero. This ensures fair tracking of each player's time on the field, even when they switch roles during the game.
