# Football Subs

It ensures that each player gets a fair amount of game time while keeping all players engaged and involved. The app allows coaches to monitor player playtimes and make informed substitution decisions in real-time.

## Features

- **Accurate Playtime Tracking with Real-Time Updates**: Player playtimes are accurately calculated based on when they start and stop playing. Playtimes update every second, even when the game is running, ensuring coaches have up-to-the-second information.
- **Accurate Game Time Calculation**: The total game time is calculated by recording each interval the game is running, summing up the total elapsed time, and updating every second. This ensures precise tracking of the total game duration, even when the game is paused and resumed.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: The game clock and player playtimes update every second during the game, allowing for precise management.
